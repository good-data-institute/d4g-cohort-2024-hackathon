In this article, we review some recent advances in the structural annotation of cell networks and discuss their potential impact on some of the hottest areas of drug development. In particular, we analyze recent structure-based strategies to target networks, protein interaction interfaces and allosteric sites, and how they will help in the development of more potent and specific treatments.

Indeed, the robustness of biological systems has revealed that the modulation of a single target is unlikely to yield the desired outcome and we should therefore move from gene-centric to systemic therapeutic strategies. Here we present the complete characterization of three murine models of AD at different stages of the disease (i.e. onset, progression and advanced). To identify genotype-to-phenotype relationships, we combine the cognitive assessment of these mice with histological analyses and full transcriptional and protein quantification profiling of the hippocampus. Comparison of the gene and protein expression trends observed in AD progression and physiological aging revealed certain commonalities, such as the upregulation of microglial and inflammation markers. However, although AD models show accelerated aging, other factors specifically associated with Aβ pathology are involved. Despite the clear correlation between mRNA and protein levels of the dysregulated genes, we discovered a few proteins whose abundance increases with AD progression, while the corresponding transcript levels remain stable. Indeed, we show that at least two of these proteins, namely lfit3 and Syt11, co-localize with Aβ plaques in the brain. Finally, we derived specific Aβ-related molecular AD …",2021,No,No,2021,9

The workshop highlighted the potential applications of computational methodologies in the search for secondary metabolites (SMs) or natural products (NPs) as potential drugs and drug leads. During 3 days, the participants of this online workshop received an overview of modern computer-based approaches for exploring NP discovery in the ""omics"" age. The invited experts gave keynote lectures, trained participants in hands-on sessions, and held round table discussions. This was followed by oral presentations with much interaction between the speakers and the audience. Selected applicants (early-career scientists) were offered the opportunity to give oral presentations (15 min) and present posters in the form of flash presentations (5 min) upon submission of an abstract. The final program available on the workshop website ( https://caismd.indiayouth.info/ ) comprised of 4 keynote lectures (KLs), 12 oral presentations (OPs), 2 round table discussions (RTDs), and 5 hands-on sessions (HSs).

Routine laboratory tests of serum creatinine have been conducted to assess HIV treatment (ART) suitability. Here we utilize those measures to assess kidney function impairment among those initiating ART. Identification of non-communicable disease (NCD) risks among those in HIV care creates opportunity to improve public health through care referral and/or NCD/HIV care integration. We estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) using routinely collected serum creatinine measures among a cohort of PLHIV with an HIV care visit at one of 113 Centre for Infectious Disease Research Zambia (CIDRZ) supported sites between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2017, across seven of the ten provinces in Zambia. We used mixed-effect Poisson regression to assess predictors of eGFR <60ml/min/1.73m2 allowing random effects at the individual and facility level. Additionally, we assessed agreement between four eGFR formulae with unadjusted CKD-EPI as a standard using Scott/Fleiss method across five categories of kidney function. A total of 72,933 observations among 68,534 individuals met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Of the 68,534, the majority were female 41,042 (59.8%), the median age was 34 (interquartile range [IQR]: 28–40), and median CD4 cell count was 292 (IQR: 162–435). The proportion of individuals with an eGFR <60ml/min/1.73m2 was 6.9% (95% CI: 6.7–7.1%) according to the unadjusted CKD-EPI equation. There was variation in agreement across eGFR formulas considered compared to unadjusted CKD-EPI (χ2 p-value <0.001). Estimated GFR less than 60ml/min/1.73m2, per the unadjusted CKD-EPI equation, was significantly associated with age, sex, body mass index, and blood pressure. Using routine serum creatinine measures, we identified a significant proportion of individuals with eGFR indicating moderate or great kidney function impairment among PLHIV initiating ART in Zambia.

We postulated that this data can be mined to define chemical features associated with sole ABS activity and/or those that provide additional life cycle activity profiles like gametocytocidal activity. Additionally, this information could provide chemical features associated with inactive compounds, which could eliminate any future unnecessary screening of similar chemical analogues. Therefore, we aimed to use machine learning to identify the chemical space associated with stage-specific antimalarial activity. We collected data from various chemical libraries that were screened against the asexual (126 374 compounds) and sexual (gametocyte) stages of the parasite (93 941 compounds), calculated the compounds’ molecular fingerprints and trained machine learning models to recognize stage-specific active and inactiv compounds. We were able to build several models that predicts compound activity against ABS and dual-activity against ABS and gametocytes, with Support Vector Machines (SVM) showing superior abilities with high recall (90% and 66%) and low false positive predictions (15% and 1%). This allowed identification of chemical features enriched in active and inactive populations, an important outcome that could be mined for essential chemical features to streamline hit-to-lead optimization strategies of antimalarial candidates.

Anemia in malaria is a multi-factorial complication, since dyserythropoiesis, hemolysis and phagocytic clearance of uninfected red blood cells (RBCs) can contribute to this syndrome. High levels of oxidative stress and immune dysregulation have been proposed to contribute to severe malarial anemia, facilitating the clearance of uninfected RBCs. In a cohort of 552 Ugandan children with severe malaria, we measured the levels of xanthine oxidase (XO), an oxidative enzyme that is elevated in the plasma of malaria patients. The levels of XO in children with severe anemia were significantly higher compared to children with severe malaria not suffering from severe anemia. Levels of XO were inversely associated with RBC hemoglobin (ρ = − 0.25, p < 0.0001), indicating a relation between this enzyme and severe anemia. When compared with the levels of immune complexes and of autoimmune antibodies to phosphatidylserine, factors previously associated with severe anemia in malaria patients, we observed that XO is not associated with them, suggesting that XO is associated with severe anemia through an independent mechanism. XO was associated with prostration, acidosis, jaundice, respiratory distress, and kidney injury, which may reflect a broader relation of this enzyme with severe malaria pathology. Since inhibitors of XO are inexpensive and well-tolerated drugs already approved for use in humans, the validation of XO as a contributor to severe malarial anemia and other malaria complications may open new possibilities for much needed adjunctive therapy in malaria.",2023,Yes,No,2023,

However, the unspecificity of early symptoms often makes difficult to identify patients at high-risk of developing severe disease. Additionally, one of the most feared malaria complications -cerebral malaria- is challenging to diagnose, often resulting in treatment delays that can lead to adverse outcomes.To identify candidate biomarkers for the prognosis and/or diagnosis of severe and cerebral malaria, we have analyzed the transcriptomic response of human brain microvascular endothelial cells to erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum. Candidates were validated in plasma samples from a cohort of malaria pediatric patients from Mozambique (n = 264), resulting in the identification of several markers with capacity to distinguish uncomplicated from severe malaria, the most potent being the metallopeptidase ADAMTS18 (AUC = 0.77, P < 0.0001). Two other biomarkers, Angiopoietin-like-4 and Inhibin-βE were able to differentiate children with cerebral malaria within the severe malaria group, showing increased sensitivity after combination in a biomarker signature (AUC = 0.76, P < 0.0001).The validation of the predicted candidate biomarkers in plasma of children with severe and cerebral malaria underscores the power of this transcriptomic approach and indicates that a specific endothelial response to P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes is linked to the pathophysiology of severe malaria.",2023,Yes,No,2023,1

In this study, we leveraged these datasets to create predictive models of cancer cells drug sensitivity. To this aim we trained explainable machine learning algorithms by employing cell line transcriptomics to predict the growth inhibitory potential of drugs. We used large language models (LLMs) to expand descriptions of the mechanisms of action (MOA) for each drug starting from available annotations, which were matched to the semantically closest pathways from reference knowledge bases. By leveraging this AI-curated resource, and the interpretability of our model, we demonstrated that pathways enriched for genes crucial for prediction often matched known drug-MOAs and essential genes, suggesting that our models learned the molecular determinants of drug response. Furthermore, we demonstrated that by incorporating only LLM-curated genes associated with MOAs, we enhanced the predictive accuracy of our drug models. To enhance translatability to a clinical setting, we employed a pipeline to align bulk RNAseq from CCLs, used for training the models, to those from patient samples, used for inference. We proved the effectiveness of our approach on TCGA samples, where patients best scoring drugs matched those prescribed for their cancer type. We further showed its usefulness by predicting and experimentally validating effective drugs for the patients of two highly lethal solid tumors, i.e. pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma. In summary, our method facilitates the inference and interpretation of cancer cell line drug sensitivity and holds potential to effectively translate them into new cancer therapeutics.",2024,Yes,No,2024,
