In addition to that output also contains 8 physicochemical properties, namely, molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond acceptors, hydrogen bond doners, Lipinski's Rule of 5, QED, stereo centers, and topological polar surface area. Furthermore, each of these outcomes is contextualized through a computation of its percentile in reference to DrugBank approved drugs.
